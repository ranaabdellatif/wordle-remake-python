# wordle-remake-python
This is a basic python program to simulate the famous game, Wordle, developed by Josh Wardle and published by the New York Times. 
The words used are imported from a downloadable USA dictionary derived from this site- http://gwicks.net/justwords.html

The game is entirely terminal based. The BYG signify the colors seen in the actual Wordle game, in which each color symbolizes the following:

B - Black: This letter is not in the word
Y - Yellow: Right letter, wrong place
G - Green: Right letter, right place

Hope you enjoy this game! Feel free to use for inspo, good luck!
